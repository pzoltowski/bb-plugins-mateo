# Dockside

**Stable projects, clear attention, inline agents.**

</div>

Dockside replaces the scrolling thread list in bb's left sidebar with a
compact project-first inbox designed for parallel agent work.

Projects and complete root/child families stay where you put them. Drag the
existing project header or a family's semantic status icon to sort, or use
Alt+Up/Alt+Down from the same focus targets. The browser-local order survives
reloads, children remain attached, and pinned roots retain their leading
partition. Sorting pauses during search, filtering, or bulk selection so hidden
rows never move implicitly.

Every family has an explicit **Failed**, **Needs you**, **Working**, **Unread**,
**Inactive**, or seven-day **Stale** state. Labels, distinct shapes, animation,
accessible help, and customizable semantic colors keep color from carrying the
meaning alone. Inactive and stale work recedes instead of using a bright unused
state, and Dockside never invents Done for ordinary idle work.

When a root has child threads, the family expands inline as an agent stack with
provider marks for Codex, Claude, and other BB providers. Pull-request metadata
stays on the parent only, including semantic ready, merged, and blocked/error
states.

You clear the list with two email verbs: **snooze** a thread until a wake time, or
**settle** it when you are done. Both shelves collapse to one counted header.

## Install

Dockside is available as an immutable Git release. Install the compatible range
from the reviewed monorepo subdirectory:

```sh
bb plugin install git:https://github.com/MateoCerquetella/bb-plugins.git@^0.1.0 \
  --subdirectory plugins/dockside \
  --tag-prefix dockside/
```

The range currently resolves [`dockside/v0.1.0`](https://github.com/MateoCerquetella/bb-plugins/tree/dockside/v0.1.0)
at the code merged by [plugin PR #26](https://github.com/MateoCerquetella/bb-plugins/pull/26).
The [BB Community marketplace submission](https://github.com/get-bb/marketplace/pull/162)
is validated and awaiting maintainer merge. Until it lands, use the Git command
above rather than a bare npm package or marketplace name.

**For development from source** — clone the repo and install the plugin as a
local path source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mateocerquetella/bb-plugins.git
cd bb-plugins
bun install
bun run --filter 'bb-plugin-dockside' build
bb plugin install ./plugins/dockside
```

The source-development path needs Bun and the `bb` CLI. The release command does
not: BB resolves the monorepo plugin through `--subdirectory` and builds the
selected immutable tag through its normal managed install pipeline.

## Requirements

- bb ≥ 0.36
- Nothing else. No accounts, keys, or external services.

## Usage

Installing does not change your sidebar by itself. Open **Settings → Appearance →
Sidebar** and choose **Dockside (projects)**.

<picture><img src="docs/media/enable.png" alt="bb's Appearance settings where a sidebar replacement can be selected" width="100%" /></picture>

bb's own list stays the default, and comes back the moment you switch away or
disable the plugin.

### Projects and parked shelves

- **Projects** — drag an existing project header to sort projects, or focus the
  same header and press Alt+Up/Alt+Down. No extra drag icon is added, and the
  browser-local project order survives reloads. Pinned roots remain first inside
  each project.
  Drag a family's semantic status icon, or focus it and press Alt+Up/Alt+Down, to move
  a complete root/child family inside its pinned or unpinned partition. The
  family order survives reloads. Clear search, choose the All filter, and
  exit bulk selection before sorting so hidden rows are never moved implicitly.
- **Snoozed** — hidden until the wake time you chose. A snoozed thread comes back early if it starts working or asks you something.
- **Settled** — work you are done with, collapsed to one line and shown for 24 hours. Settling also **archives the thread in bb**, so every other surface agrees, and new attention un-settles and unarchives it. After a day the row stops being drawn but stays archived.

An empty shelf disappears.

### Cards

Root rows always use exactly two compact lines. The first has a distinct semantic
icon, truncated title, and elapsed time. The second has a truncated branch and a
non-wrapping cluster with a readable status badge, parent-only PR metadata, and
child/provider controls. **Failed**, **Needs you**, **Working**, **Unread**,
**Inactive**, and seven-day **Stale** states have separate shapes, labels,
tooltips, and customizable colors. Inactive and stale work recede; Dockside never
calls ordinary idle work Done. A Working family keeps the actual activity type
visible: runtime, workflow, background agent, command, plan, and goal each use a
different animated shape and customizable color. PR ticks and other PR icons use
their semantic color as a tinted background, so a ready tick is visibly green.
Hovering a quiet root swaps its elapsed time for the two park buttons without
adding a row.

### A working thread can never be parked

Workflows, background agents, background commands, plan mode, and goals all count as
live work. Any of them blocks parking and wakes a parked thread, so running work is
never hidden.

### Snoozing

The hover button snoozes until **09:00 tomorrow**.

### Inline agents

A root with child threads gets an agent count and disclosure. The stack opens by
default when the family is selected or a child is working, unread, or waiting for
you. Child rows keep their own provider mark (including Codex and Claude), branch,
age, working state, unread ring, context menu, split drag, and keyboard-readable
status help. Provider names are announced by the child disclosure without adding
nested tab stops. A parent chip in the thread header still gives a focused child
a direct route back up.

### The rest

- Collapsible project and agent groups.
- Right-click for open in split, mark read/unread, pin, archive, delete.
- Drag a card to a split pane, or Cmd/Ctrl-click to open one.
- Status-icon reordering is separate from BB's card-to-split drag target and
  adds no extra row icon.
- bb's search, its thread shortcuts, and modifier-click split-open all keep working.

## Switching from t3sidebar

Dockside is a new plugin identity, not an in-place release of t3sidebar. It
uses a separate bb database and separate `dockside:v1:*` browser keys, so it
starts with an empty Snoozed and Settled state. It does **not** migrate or
delete the old plugin's parked threads.

Keep t3sidebar installed but disabled until you no longer need its snoozed or
settled rows. You can re-enable it temporarily to inspect that state. Removing
the old plugin may remove its private database; Dockside never performs that
removal for you.

Sidebar selection is per client. Choose **Dockside (projects)** on each desktop,
browser, or remote client where you want to use it.

## Configuration

Dockside Settings offers Default, High contrast, Colorblind-friendly, and Custom
semantic palettes. Every status, live activity type, and PR role is previewed;
custom values accept only six-digit hex colors and otherwise fall back safely.
You can also choose row density, default child expansion, provider marks,
parent-only PR metadata, and relative-time visibility.

Project badges default to two letters — initials for multi-word names
(`BB Plugins` → `BP`), the first two characters for single-word names
(`taskboard` → `TA`). Switch them back to one letter in Settings → Dockside →
Badge letters. Automatic badge colors hash the rendered letters, so the same
letters always get the same color; a per-project badge color still wins.

When **Prefer project icon** is on (the default), Dockside looks for a
`favicon.*`, `icon.*`, `logo.*`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, or an `app.json`
`expo.icon` in the project's local source and shows it instead of letters.
Missing, oversized (>256 KiB), non-image, or non-local sources fall back to
letters, and personal projects never get icons. Turn it off to always use
letters.

The snooze presets still assume a 09:00 morning, an 18:00 evening, and a week
starting Monday in your local timezone. The settled shelf reaches back 24 hours.
Those timing constants are not configurable.

## Troubleshooting

**My sidebar looks the same after installing.** Choose Dockside in Settings →
Appearance → Sidebar. Installing alone changes nothing.

**A thread I settled is not on the Settled shelf.** The shelf only reaches back 24
hours. Older work is still settled and still archived — look for it in bb's archived
view.

**A snoozed thread came back early.** That is the design: a snoozed thread wakes when
it starts working or asks you a question.

**Un-settling did not bring the thread back.** Archive and unarchive run on the
thread's host, which can be offline. When an unarchive fails, bb keeps the thread
archived and the thread leaves the sidebar until you unarchive it in bb yourself.

**Uninstalling left data behind.** The shelves live in the plugin's own database,
which bb removes with the plugin — but a copy of them is cached in the browser's
`localStorage` under `dockside:v1:*` (thread ids, park timestamps, and legacy
provider metadata). bb's uninstall does not clear web storage. Clear site data
if that matters to you. The separate `t3sidebar:v1:*` keys belong to the old
plugin and are not claimed by Dockside.

The provider brand marks are vendored SVG geometry from `get-bb/bb` and depict
third-party brands. A host-served logo always wins over them, rendered as a muted
silhouette rather than in brand color — by design.

## Develop from source

Install from source as shown under [Install](#install), then check a change
with:

```sh
